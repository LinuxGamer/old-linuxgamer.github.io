<p><h1>New Upload Schedule</h1></p>
<!--<p><h2>Why Do I Keep Returning to Fedora</h2></p>-->
<p>I have recently been trying to improve my YouTube channel, including a new upload schedule.</p>
<p>The new posting schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>I will upload a new video once a week on either Monday or Friday</p>
<p>I will also try to get one longer video premiering once a month... but I cannot promise it.</p>
